Fetch 'Em
===================================
An application that consumes data from https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json and displays it. The data 
is grouped by "listId", and then further sorted by "name". I tried to make it a bit more fun, so you may notice some 
additional functionality.

Most notably, there is a login screen. You may use either of the following credentials:

E-mail: fetchem.adm@gmail.com\
Password: admin1234

OR

E-mail: fetchem.user@gmail.com\
Password: user1234

Depending on which login you use, there is different functionality available.

**TO VIEW REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY, PLEASE USE THE ADMIN USER.**

As I continue to work on this, the admin user will be given the following capabilities:
- Upload any item to server with picture of Jenko (my dog)

The normal user will be given the following capabilities:
- View any uploaded items from the server
- Rate and review items (Jenko pictures). Some pictures of Jenko are cuter than others...

Obviously as this evolves out of the scope of this assignment, there won't be a need for me
to associate the items present in the JSON response with pictures of Jenko. For now, though, we leave it be!
